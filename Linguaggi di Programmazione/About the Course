Linguaggi di Programmazione

Objectives
Students will learn various programming paradigms, particularly the logic and functional paradigms. They will also learn to use programming environments for the main languages presented. Students will be able to develop small to medium-sized projects in (Common) Lisp and Prolog using the programming environments introduced.
